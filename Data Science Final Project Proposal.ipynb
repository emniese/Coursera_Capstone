With Charlotte's rapid growth and the current interest in sustainable food, there should be at least one neighborhood in Charlotte that can support such a restaurant.  To identify an optimal location for this restaurant I will need to look for areas of the city that has other mid to high end restaurants, indicating that locals have the financial resources needed to eat out re but is not oversaturated with such options.  Such a neighborhood would have other mid range restaurants and a geographic location with enough residents to support a new restaurant.  Another issue that would need to be addressed prior to opening such a restaurant is finding sufficient local farmers to purchase food from,but that is outside the scope of this project."
